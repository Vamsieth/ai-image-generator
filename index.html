        <h1>AI image generator</h1>
        <p>Write your prompt to generate images, It creates an image from scratch using Gen Ai & Stable diffusion.
            <br>
            This can be used to generate AI art, or for general silliness.

            Don't expect the quality to be photorealistic, however. You would need a really really big AI to do that.
            
            If you can't think of something, try "Balloon in the shape of X" where X is something you wouldn't find in balloon form.
